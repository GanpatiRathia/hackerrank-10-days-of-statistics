# A bag contains 3 red marbles and 4 blue marbles. Then, 2 marbles are drawn from
# the bag, at random, without replacement. If the first marble is red, what is
# the probability that the second marble is blue?

# First marble is red, left six marbles in the bag, whose the four are blue,
# then 4/6 or 2/3

print("Result: {}".format(2/3))
